Welcome to DataArc Ecosystem Explorer's documentation! TEST
======================================================

This guide will serve as the overview and tutorial for getting acquainted with the |DEE|. The Ecosystem Explorer is
designed to help dataset contributors think through mapping their data to the DataArc community's knowledge map of the
concept of "changing landscapes" and to help advanced users better understand how data and concepts are connected in the
DataArc Ecosystem. The Ecosystem Explorer is provided as a Jupyter Notebook, containing tools for exploring the DataArc
Concept Map, which is structured as an |ug_graph|, and data connections to it. The flow chart below can help guide
your experience and point you toward the materials needed to complete your goals.
